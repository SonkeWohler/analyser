/**
 * This package contains {@link DataSet} and its subclasses. These are designed to hold information
 * on collections of data that is to be accessed by an 'independent value' (also xValue). For
 * illustration, measurements over time would be stored in a {@link ValueDataSet} where time is the
 * independent value and the measured quantity (say temperature) is the dependent value (or yValue).
 * Each temperature measurement is then stored relative to its corresponding time.
